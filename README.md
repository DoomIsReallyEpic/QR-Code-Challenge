## My process

### What I learned

I mostly learned more about how to properly center elements. I'm not very familiar with that so it was nice to learn how to do it considering I actually struggled to center the footer for a bit (It was always at the right). 

body {
    background-color: hsl(212, 45%, 89%);
    text-align: center;
    font-family: Outfit;
    min-height: 100vh;
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    justify-content: center;
}

This snippet of code is what I'm most proud of because it helped me fix the problem with the footer not being in the center.

### Continued development

I want to continue practicing CSS as a whole, specifically responsive designs, as I'm still not very experienced with it. I've seen people make really cool things with it, and that's why I wanna improve on it. 

### Useful resources

I basically used Youtube as a way on how to complete specific things on this project. Any tutorial works!
